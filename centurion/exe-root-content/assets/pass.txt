the files "pass.xml" contain the information about the object collision (pass ~ passable).
they provide x and y values, that indicate the number of rows and columns of the pass matrix they occupy.

the pass matrix is a grid of 0/1 values. each cell covers 32x32 pixels of the game map.

if the map is 30720x20480 pixels, the pass matrix is 920x640 (because there is a margin of 2*640 on each side of the map.)

to activate/deactivate the pass matrix, simply write "Editor.ToggleGrid()" to Hector (the Lua interpreter), 
using the console (activable with F1 in the editor).

the object pass grid is stored in the XML with hexadecimal characters, in order to represent 4 binary values
with just one character and save bytes. 

for this, to get an optimal result, the pass.png images should have height and width multiples of 128
because 128 = 32 (cell grid size) * 4 (number of binary characters).
